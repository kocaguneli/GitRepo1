%\section{Research Interests}
%
%~\\My main research interest is data science with a strong focus on data mining, machine learning and empirical software engineering (ESE).
%Specifically I work on: (1) Finding stable predictive models; (2) Reducing industrial data requirements; (3) Enabling data transfer between different domains.
%For these purposes: (1) I developed a framework model of ensemble learning that assembles learners (among variants of classification and regression trees, neural nets, support vector machines, analogy-based methods, regression methods) into stable ensembles; (2) Generated an active learning-based data reduction model that can reduce ESE data sets down to 10\% of the original data without performance loss; (3) Provided a transfer learning method that can successfully select and transfer relevant training instances between different data domains.
%
%I have a strong focus on the practical realities of industrial data mining.
%Therefore, I supported my research with various industry funded research projects and internships.
%I am also the co-author of an ongoing book project (to be published by Morgan Kaufman) explaining data and model issues of contemporary industrial data mining.
